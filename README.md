## üîç Embrace SDK - User Flow Tracking

This app implements comprehensive breadcrumb tracking using the Embrace SDK to monitor three distinct checkout user flows.

### Flow 1: Checkout Started ‚Üí Shipping Completed

Tracks the user journey from checkout initiation through shipping information completion.

| Breadcrumb | Location | Description |
|------------|----------|-------------|
| `CHECKOUT_STARTED` | `CheckoutCoordinator.swift:51` | When checkout is initialized |
| `SHIPPING_INFORMATION_COMPLETED` | `ShippingInformationViewController.swift:204` | When user completes shipping form |
| `CHECKOUT_SHIPPING_COMPLETED` | `CheckoutCoordinator.swift:81` | When transitioning to payment step |

### Flow 2: Shipping Completed ‚Üí Payment Completed

Tracks the payment processing flow from shipping completion through successful payment.

| Breadcrumb | Location | Description |
|------------|----------|-------------|
| `STRIPE_PAYMENT_PROCESSING_STARTED` | `StripePaymentView.swift:267` | When payment processing begins |
| `STRIPE_PAYMENT_PROCESSING_SUCCESS` | `StripePaymentView.swift:293` | When payment succeeds |
| `STRIPE_PAYMENT_PROCESSING_FAILED` | `StripePaymentView.swift:308` | When payment fails |
| `CHECKOUT_PAYMENT_COMPLETED` | `CheckoutCoordinator.swift:84` | When transitioning to confirmation step |

### Flow 3: Payment Completed ‚Üí Order Details API Complete

Tracks the final order placement flow from payment completion through successful order creation.

| Breadcrumb | Location | Description |
|------------|----------|-------------|
| `PLACE_ORDER_INITIATED` | `OrderConfirmationViewController.swift:174` | When user taps place order |
| `ORDER_DETAILS_API_COMPLETED` | `CheckoutCoordinator.swift:177` | When order API call completes successfully |
| `ORDER_PLACED_SUCCESS` | `OrderConfirmationViewController.swift:211` | When order placement succeeds |
| `ORDER_PLACED_FAILED` | `OrderConfirmationViewController.swift:230` | When order placement fails |

### Monitoring User Journeys

These breadcrumbs allow you to:
- Track conversion rates through each checkout step
- Identify drop-off points in the checkout flow
- Monitor payment processing success/failure rates
- Analyze the complete user journey from cart to order completion
- Debug issues specific to each flow step

The breadcrumbs are automatically captured in your Embrace sessions and can be viewed in the Embrace dashboard for comprehensive user flow analysis.
